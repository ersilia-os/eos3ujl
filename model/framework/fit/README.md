We observed some errors in the processing of Mordred descriptors, so we have developed a simple imputer based on DrugBank data.

Only successfully standardised drug molecules where used (over 8,0000), and then the `smi2desc_nah.py` script was run to obtain the Mordred descriptors as they use them in the article.
